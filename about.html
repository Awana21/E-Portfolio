    <p>Hello world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Awana Castro,a passionate individual who fell in love with coding and product management in 2022. Since then, I've been teaching myself the fundamentals. I have learned the fundamentals of coding languages and frameworks, as well as product/project management, from a variety of sites, including CodeFirstGirls, Coursera, Udemy, Codecademy, and YouTube. What captivates me the most about product management is the high level of creativity and invention required to solve problems while maintaining a user-centric focus. I'm thrilled to start a career that will allow me to use my creativity and innovation to manage products that have purpose and solve real problems. ðŸ’»
